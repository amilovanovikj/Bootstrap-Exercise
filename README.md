# Bootstrap-Exercise

The code from my experiments with bootstrap's grid system and card component.

## What I learned:
- How bootstrap's grid system works and how to use the container, row and column classes.
- How to have different number of columns in one row for different screen sizes.
- How to use bootstrap's card component as a container and style html elements inside it.
- How to change bootstrap classes dynamically when the screen size changes (resizes) using jQuery.
